  |   Your home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking    |
  |   invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with      |
  |   every passing moment. As you rise to take your father's place as      |
  |   ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no        |
  |   mistake - this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for     |
  |   survival.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite.       |
  |   Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking          |
  |   invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command    |
  |   your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique     |
  |   shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the     |
  |   blood of your subjects stain the ground red.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   It's charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated         |
  |   islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained    |
  |   realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle,        |
  |   giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to     |
  |   carry them out in the heat of the moment. It's accessibly deep,       |
  |   with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that    |
  |   make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Keep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for    |
  |   hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad        |
  |   North.                                                                |

  |   Bad North: Jotunn Edition.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As a reminder, this update includes campaign changes, difficulty      |
  |   enhancements, new features, and more. Additional information can be   |
  |   found below.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Campaign Changes.                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We've reworked the campaign progression to show the enemy types on    |
  |   levels, advance the Viking Frontier faster and replaced individual    |
  |   gold with a shared gold pool. This is all comes together to allow     |
  |   you to make much more informed strategic decisions between levels     |
  |   and makes tackling multiple islands per turn a more viable            |
  |   approach.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   New Upgrades & Meta Progression.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There's 4 more Items to find and we're also introducing Commander     |
  |   Traits - smaller, passive buffs for your Commanders - so more than    |
  |   ever you will need to work with what you have and each run will be    |
  |   more unique. Over time you can unlock all these Items and Traits as   |
  |   Starting Upgrades, which you can select for your initial 2            |
  |   commanders when starting a new game.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Difficulty Enhancements.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There are some new options for more casual play, such as Checkpoint   |
  |   Islands which give you a reset point, acting as a safety net for      |
  |   when your campaign reaches a tragic conclusion. You can also opt      |
  |   out of the "Iron Man" behaviour of the game by enabling Replayable    |
  |   Levels on a new campaign (no more save scrubbing needed!). And if     |
  |   more casual is not what you're looking for, we've also added an       |
  |   unlockable Very Hard difficulty for those who want the challenge.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   And the Rest...                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   On top of this we've tweaked up a lot of the basic / core             |
  |   mechanics, tightened up a lot of gameplay, polished the visuals       |
  |   further and added some quality of life features.                      |
  |                                                                         |
